This directory contains a demo of LaTeX's Prosper documentclass for
making slides.


--- MANIFEST -------------------------------------------------------

README
	this file

slides.tex
	the main LaTeX source for slides

ns-2d-p.eps
ns-2d-u.eps
ns-2d-v.eps
	figures to be included in the slides

Makefile
	a UNIX makefile, see comments below


--- The UMBC style files -------------------------------------------

The layout and colors in this demo are designed to look best with
UMBC's Prosper styles.  The demo should compile with any other Prosper
style, however the results will not be ideal because slide dimensions,
fonts sizes and color pallets vary widely from style to style.

In general, when you create your own Prosper document, first you pick
a style, then lay out the contents to fit that specific style.

Download UMBC's Prosper styles from:

    http://www.math.umbc.edu/~rouben/prosper/prosper-umbc.tgz


--- How to compile -------------------------------------------------

To compile the slides, do:

	latex slides.tex         # will create slides.dvi
	dvips -t a4 slides.dvi   # will create slides.ps
	ps2pdf slides.ps         # will create slides.pdf

To view slides.ps, do:

	gv -landscape slides.ps

To view slides.pdf, do:

	acroread slides.pdf      # view the resulting pdf file


--- Using the provided Makefile ------------------------------------

Instead of typing the compilation com ands in the previous paragraph,
you may just type:

	make			# will create slides.pdf

This automatically will executes the following steps:

	slides.tex --> slides.dvi --> slides.ps --> slides.pdf

To stop after creating the dvi file, type:

	make dvi

To stop after creating the ps file, type:

	make ps

The command "make" is equivalent to "make pdf"

To remove files created by Makefile and restore the original state
of this directory, type:

	make clean
